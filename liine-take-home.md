### Take Home Assignment 

__Use whatever programming language you feel most comfortable in.__

Take the CSV data file given in this gist and write a function `find_open_restaurants(csv_filename, search_datetime)` which takes as parameters a filename and a datetime object and returns a list of restaurant names which are open on that date and time. Optimized solutions are nice, but correct solutions are more important!

### Assumptions:
* If a day of the week is not listed, the restaurant is closed on that day
* All times are local — don’t worry about timezone-awareness
* The CSV file will be well-formed, assume all names and hours are correct

If you have any questions, let me know. Use git to track your progress, and push your solution to a github repository (public or if private just give me access @sharpmoose)
